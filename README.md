# [PostingScheduleToSlackReminders]()

A basic parser that takes the SASE posting schedules and turns them into a Slack reminders, instead of writing them yourself

Here's an example template.txt

```
Event Title: S21 GBM
Schedule:
3/26: @Kevin @Su @Viwing
3/28: @Tarana @Joshua @Jackie
3/30: @Emily @Sabrina @Christina @Thomas
3/31: @Andy @Jason @Dylan
4/1: @Allen @Natasha @Kianna
```

These characters are reserved, thus you must NOT use these in your template.txt

- :
- "
- \
- /
- @
